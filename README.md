# In the Éire - Find "staycations" in Ireland

[View the deployed site here.](https://adowlin.github.io/project-2-staycations/)

In the Éire is a website where users can search for holiday destinations within Ireland. This website was created for my second milestone project as part of the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development course with Code Institute. The website is responsive on all device sizes.

## User Experience (UX)

With international travel restrictions throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, "staycations" - holidays within Ireland - have grown in popularity. This website will allow users to search for holiday destinations within Ireland, providing information about accommodation, restaurants, and attractions in that they search for. The website will advance the user's goals of finding holiday destinations in Ireland by providing this search feature. It will also advance the site owner's goals of promoting Irish businesses, and finding holiday destinations being a user of the site themselves.

### User Stories

- As a first-time visitor, I want to:
    - Search for holiday destinations in Ireland.
    - See places of interest and attractions near my preferred destination.
    - Find & book accomodation & restaurants near my preferred destination.
    - Contact the site owner with any questions.

- As a returning visitor, I want to:
    - Search for new holiday destinations in Ireland.
    - Find restaurants & attractions near my current location, if I am already on holiday.

### Design

- Colour Scheme:

    <img src="/readme-assets/images/staycations-palette.png" alt="color palette" style="width:400px;height:300px;">

    - Colour palette was generated using [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/). I chose this colour scheme as it offers sufficient contrasts, and aligns with the Irish theme of the site by using colours similar to the Irish Tricolour.

- Typography:
    - Using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), I chose [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather) for the site's logo and headings, paired with [Merriweather Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather+Sans) for the site's main text.

### Wireframes
