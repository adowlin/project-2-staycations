# In the Éire - Find "staycations" in Ireland

[View the deployed site here.](https://adowlin.github.io/project-2-staycations/)

In the Éire is a website where users can search for holiday destinations within Ireland. This website was created for my second milestone project as part of the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development course with Code Institute. The website is responsive on all device sizes.

## User Experience (UX)

With international travel restrictions throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, "staycations" - holidays within Ireland - have grown in popularity. This website will allow users to search for holiday destinations within Ireland, providing information about accommodation, restaurants, and attractions in that they search for. The website will advance the user's goals of finding holiday destinations in Ireland by providing this search feature. It will also advance the site owner's goals of promoting Irish businesses, and finding holiday destinations being a user of the site themselves.
